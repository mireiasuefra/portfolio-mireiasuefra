Hello world! 
This is my portfolio and in it I tell you about myself and my motivations, I also show you some of the projects I've done and if you want to contact me, you have a form to ask me anything you want.

## Comments 📚

I have chosen React as the framework for the exercise, as it is the one I am most familiar with. To create the project, I used [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and added SASS to work with the styles.

## Built with 🚀

* [React](https://reactjs.org) as a JavaScript library.
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as a superset of JavaScript.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as CSS framework.


## Getting Started ⚙️

- Clone this repo:
  ```shell
  git clone 
  ```

- Install dependencies
  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

- Run it
  ```shell
  npm start
  ```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


## Improvements 📝
